# Data Science and Machine Learning Applied to Financial Markets

Scripts and tasks done during the postgraduate in data science and machine learning applied to financial markets.

## About the file naming convention

The Jupyter Notebooks are being titled with the date of the lecture, the lecture number, the post-graduate group number and the author's name.

If a Jupyter Notebook was written by me, it will have the letters **DRG** at the end of it's name.

Whether a lecturer uses a different naming convention, it will be updated here.
